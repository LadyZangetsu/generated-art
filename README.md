Algorithmic Art
==============================

What Is This?
-------------

Algorithmic Art is art designed by an algorithm.

The code in main.py generates a pattern algorithmically by walking across the page, 
avoiding intersections and shifting randomly when no moves possible.

Issues
-------------
The Turtle library is intended as a tool for introducing programing to children and 
as such as many limitations when used as a graphics library.

Next Steps
-------------
- Review graphics libraries and replace Turtle with something more appropriate.
- Change code to take input of points to fill with the pattern.
